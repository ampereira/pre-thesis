\chapter{Research Plan}
\label{thesis_planning}

The research plan for the PhD thesis work is organised as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item For the first semester of 2014/2015:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requirements elicitation of all physics features to implement on the framework together with the LIP researchers.
		\item Validate the proposed framework design and new data analysis programming model.
		\item Redesign of the features already implemented in LipMiniAnalysis to fit the new framework requirements.
		\item Assess and compare the performance of various C++ collections to store various events on memory.
		\item Extend the current event data structure to fit the requirements of all data analysis:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item By adding the all variables in the ROOT input data files, or;
			\item By the user defining which variables are needed for a given analysis, and the data structure being automatically created using that information;
		\end{itemize}
		\item Extend the I/O features available in LipMiniAnalysis:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item By reading multiple input data files in parallel;
			\item By build the event data structure in parallel;
		\end{itemize}
		\item Assess and compare the performance of DICE, StarPU, and Legion libraries and their available performance models for irregular workload balance in:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Homogeneous systems;
			\item Heterogeneous systems with hardware accelerators;
			\item Heterogeneous cluster nodes;
		\end{itemize}
		\item Support for hybrid process/thread automatic parallelization with partial integration with the chosen parallelization library.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Present the first framework prototype without hardware accelerator support in March 2015.
	\item For the second semester of 2014/2015:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Assess the extendibility of the chosen parallelization framework to support the \intel Xeon Phi hardware accelerator.
		\item Complete the proposed framework integration with the parallelization library to support GPU accelerators.
		\item Adapt the parallelization library to support \intel Xeon Phi accelerator.
	\end{itemize}
	\item For 2015/2016:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Update the state of the art research on software and hardware environments for heterogeneous platforms.
		\item Improve the performance across multiple computing nodes in cluster environments.
		\item Extend the functionalities of the proposed framework.
		\item Thesis write up.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
