Most event data analysis tasks in the ATLAS Experiment require intensive data accessing and processing, where the computing performance of the applications constrain both event throughput and accuracy of the physics properties studied. This work focus on the compute bound issues at the last stage of ATLAS detector data analysis.

The goal for this work is to provide an efficient unified particle physics framework, to aid the development of data analysis applications within the LIP research group. It will replace the LipMiniAnalysis skeleton library, developed by LIP, and offer a more robust tool that efficiently uses the available computational resources of multi-CPU platforms coupled with hardware accelerators, while abstracting the intrinsic complexities of theses systems to the user. It will redefine the programming model of data analysis, by implementing I/O features and providing efficient data structures, where the user only has to code the specifics of each analysis.

Once the inefficiencies of the LipMiniAnalysis skeleton library were identified, it was proposed a design of the new particle physics framework. It overcomes the data structure inefficiencies of LipMiniAnalysis and allows for a kernel-like programming model of data analysis, while automatically handling the data I/O, event data structure creation, and efficient load balancing among multiple CPU cores and hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and the \intel Xeon Phi. Most computing features of the framework are detailed in the design specification.

Several prototypes of some of the framework features were implemented and tested in the current LipMiniAnalysis skeleton library. This document presents a new data structure capable of holding multiple events in memory, an automatic parallelization of the even processing in a multi-CPU computing node, and a dynamic interface generator to integrate the framework with legacy data analysis without changes to their code.
